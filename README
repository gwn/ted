## ted

Lightweight ergonomic interactive command line task list editor

[`ed`](http://wiki.c2.com/?EdIsTheStandardTextEditor) for tasks

For the people who appreciate the simplicity of traditional TODO
files but who also has a lot of tasks and wish they were easily
taggable sortable filterable without requiring an ugly and bloated
issue tracker.

Read on to see what's different from existing command line task
managers.


## features & design choices

- `ted` is an editor that works on a given task directory. It has
  no implicit project database. The "project" IS the directory you
  supply.

- `ted` supports tag based categorization & filtering and priority
  based ordering.

- `ted` has no configuration, no command line flags and has only
  around 10 commands. You can get comfortable with the whole
  feature set in 15 minutes.

- `ted` stores tasks as regular files in the task directory being
  edited. The directory and file structures are very simple and
  VCS-friendly. Diffs will be straightforward if you track your
  changes.

- `ted` is interactive. Commands are sent from inside the `ted`
  shell. You don't have to repeat the `ted` command every time.
  There is no non-interactive mode as `ted` is intended to be used
  directly by its end power-users all the time and not by scripts.

- `ted` is stateful. It remembers the filter, order and limit you
  set so you don't type them again and again.

- All commands are single letter but intuitive (like c for create,
  e for edit, etc). You need A LOT less keystrokes to accomplish
  things compared to many other command line task managers.

- `ted` is not tightly coupled to any version control or
  synchronization system.

- `ted` is similar to the venerable UNIX editor `ed` (which is THE
  standard editor). This only appeals to UNIX geeks though.


## non-features

Things that are intentionally not supported and suggested
alternatives:

- Attribution & synchronization: Use a VCS

- Assignments: Use tags like `@john`, `@jack`

- Statuses: Use tags like `!doing`, `!rejected`, `!blocked`

- Attachments: Link to files on the cloud

- Discussions, mentions, merge requests: Use e-mail lists, e-mail,
  patches over e-mail


## usage

    npm install -g ted-editor
    ted myissues


## commands

**Display:**

    <empty>               List tasks that match the current filter
    <id>                  Show task #<id>
    t                     Show tag list
    f                     Show current filter
    o                     Show current order
    l                     Show current limit

**Modify filter order limit:**

    f & <t1> [<t2> ..]  Set filter for all matching tags
    f | <t1> [<t2> ..]  Set filter for any matching tag
    f / <regex>         Set filter for given regex
    F                   Reset filter

    o <col1> [<col2> ..]  Set column(s) to order the list by. Prefix column names with "-" for descending order
    O                     Reset order

    l <lim>               Set limit
    L                     Reset limit

**Manipulate task:**

    c                     Create new task with system editor
    c <title>             Create new task immediately with the given title

    e <id>                Edit task with system editor
    t <id> <t1> [<t2> ..] Add/remove tags to/from task. Prefix a tag with "-" to remove it.
    p <id> <pri>          Set task priority

    a <id>                Archive task
    A <id>                Unarchive task

    d <id>                Delete task completely

**Other:**

    a                     Start working on archived tasks
    A                     Stop working on archived tasks
    h                     Help
    q                     Quit
    reindex               Update the internal index. Call after manual updates


## task file format

    title

    priority tag1 tag2 tag3

    description lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet consectetuer adipisicing elit

    some more important stuff

    - a list
    - in the description


## on indexing

`ted` represents your tasks as simple files on the filesystem; but
it doesn't read each file every time you send a list command;
instead it lists them from an index file that it keeps track of.

This means that `ted` updates the index every time you add, update
or delete a task.

If the index is corrupted; `ted` will probably misbehave, crash
even.

If you suspect that the index is corrupted for any reason, you
should use the `reindex` command to rebuild the index.

Here are the most common scenarios that result in index
corruption:

- You update your task files with something other than `ted`. If
  you choose to do this (which is ok) you should open your task
  directory with `ted` after your updates and reindex.

- You keep track of your tasks with a VCS and you make a
  non-fast-forward merge which results in a conflict within the
  index. Resolve the conflict by following the steps below:

  - Open the index file
  - Choose any one of the index lines (doesn't matter) and remove
    the other
  - Save and close the file
  - Open the task directory with `ted`
  - Reindex
